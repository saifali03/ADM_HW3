So, here we detail the procedure to follow for the data collection. We strongly suggest you work on different modules when implementing the required functions. For example, you may have a crawler.py module, a parser.py module, and a engine.py module: this is a good practice that improves readability in reporting and efficiency in deploying the code. Be careful; you are likely dealing with exceptions and other possible issues!\n",

Your task is to collect the URL associated with each restaurant in this list. The output of this step should be a .txt file where each line contains a single restaurant’s URL. By the end, you should have approximately 2,000 restaurants on your list. The number changes daily, so some groups might have different number of restaurants."

    "### Query Functions Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This script defines two functions for handling restaurant queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. conjunctive_query (query, dictionary, inverted_index)\n",
    "This function processes a conjunctive query (AND search) to find restaurants that match all the keywords in the query as point 2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: The query is cleaned and tokenized into unique words.\n",
    "- **Inverted Index Lookup**: For each unique word, the function retrieves the corresponding document IDs (restaurants) from the inverted index.\n",
    "- **Intersection**: It computes the intersection of the document lists for all query words to find the common documents (restaurants).\n",
    "- **Return Data**: The matching restaurants are then retrieved from the dataset using the intersection of document IDs and returned as a DataFrame with key restaurant details such as name, address, and description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. customized_query (query_text, dictionary, inverted_index, TFiDF, vocabulary, query_price, query_services)\n",
    "This function refines the results from \"conjunctive_query\" by considering additional filters like price range, available services, and cuisine types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precise Match Filtering**: First, the \"conjunctive_query\" function is used to filter the restaurants based on the query text.\n",
    "- **TF-IDF Scoring**: A TF-IDF score is calculated for each restaurant based on the query words. The score is accumulated for each matching term in the restaurant descriptions.\n",
    "- **Price Range Scoring**: A price score is added, where restaurants with a price range close to the user's query receive a higher score.\n",
    "- **Services and Cuisine Scoring**: Restaurants are further scored based on the presence of requested facilities and services, as well as the type of cuisine.\n",
    "- **Sorting**: The results are sorted by the accumulated score in descending order using \"heapq\" for efficient sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "The final result is a sorted list of restaurants, with the most relevant ones appearing at the top, based on the combination of query match, TF-IDF score, price range, services, and cuisine type.\n"

    "### **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The scoring function with weighted variables** (used in customized_query) produces the most relevant and well-rounded results, as it integrates multiple factors that can affect a restaurant’s suitability for the query. The **Cuculia** restaurant is a standout due to its garden, and the overall scores give a clearer picture of the restaurants' relevance. It is especially useful for a query that implies several considerations (vegan, garden, type of restaurant).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **The similarity score function** (used in ranked_search) is less effective in this context. While it ranks **Sale Grosso** and **Li Lioni**, it doesn’t capture the nuances of the query well because it relies purely on textual similarity, without considering the full context of the query (e.g., garden space, vegan offerings). It thus produces results that are not well aligned with the user's search intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The conjunctive query** (used in conjunctive_query), while focusing on keyword matching, does not perform well either. It doesn’t fully capture the intent of the user, as it returns restaurants like **Il Mirto** and **Li Lioni**, which may be vegan but do not mention a garden in the description. This method is highly restrictive because it only matches exact keywords and does not account for context or other relevant criteria like ambiance or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: \n",
    "The **scoring function with weighted variables** offers **the best results** because it provides a more comprehensive and accurate ranking of restaurants, taking into account not only the query keywords but also essential factors like the restaurant's environment (e.g., garden) and amenities, alongside cuisine type and price. This makes it more likely to return results that align with the user's needs, whereas the other two functions either rely too heavily on simple keyword matching or similarity without context, leading to less precise outcomes.\n",

Ask a Large Language Model (LLM): Alternatively, you can compile a list of unique cities and regions in Italy, formatted as (City, Region), and ask an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to provide coordinates for these locations. This can be an efficient way to gather data without using API calls. Just make sure that the retrieved information is correct and helpful.\n",

    "    * Use color-coding or marker size to represent the restaurant's price range (€, €€, €€€, €€€€).\n",

    "5. Plot Top-K Restaurants: Use the custom score from Step 3 to select the top-k restaurants for display.\n",

    "### **AQ2. Proof of Correctness**\n",
    "##### Case 1: n = 1\n",
    "For a single package $(x, y)$, the robot can always reach the package using exactly x right moves and y up moves.\n",
    "The output path $'R' ⋅ x + 'U' ⋅ y$ is valid and lexicographically smallest by construction.\n",
    "##### Case 2: General Case (n > 1)\n",
    "Sorting ensures that the robot processes the packages in order of increasing $x$-coordinates. Within packages with the same $x$-coordinate, it processes those with increasing $y$-coordinates.\n",
    "If the sorted order is invalid (i.e., $x_2 < x_1$ or $y_2 < y_1$), the algorithm correctly identifies this and outputs \"NO.\"\n",
    "##### Feasibility:\n",
    "The algorithm checks all pairs of consecutive packages in the sorted list to ensure that moving between them is feasible without moving left or down.\n",
    "If any pair violates this condition, the robot cannot collect all packages, and the algorithm outputs \"NO.\"\n",
    "##### Path Construction:\n",
    "The algorithm constructs the path by calculating the exact number of right and up moves needed to reach each package from the current position.\n",
    "Because the coordinates are sorted lexicographically, the robot always moves in the lexicographically smallest way.\n",
    "By appending right moves first ('R' ⋅ steps_r) followed by up moves ('U' ⋅ steps_u), the algorithm ensures the path is constructed in lexicographical order.\n",
    "##### Output Correctness:\n",
    "If the feasibility check passes, the algorithm outputs \"YES\" and the constructed path. Both are correct because the robot can visit all packages in order without violating the movement constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further consider some edge cases:\n",
    "+ Single Test Case (t == 1): The loop correctly handles a single test case.\n",
    "+ Multiple Test Cases: The algorithm handles each test case independently, so results from one test case do not affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary Values:\n",
    "+ If n == 1, the algorithm outputs the correct path.\n",
