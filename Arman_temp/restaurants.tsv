0	La Trattoria Enrico Bartolini	Località Badiola	Castiglione della Pescaia	58043	Italy	€€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Grills	After a majestic picture-postcard approach via a long avenue lined with cypress trees and maritime pines, passing vineyards and Maremma cattle along the way, you finally arrive at this restaurant which serves trattoria-style cuisine full of intense, familiar and reassuring flavours. The decor here is elegant with the occasional rustic touch, while the service is of the highest level yet pleasantly friendly and informal. Welcome to Bartolini’s Maremma restaurant! Here, resident chef Bruno De Moura Cossio offers a choice of dishes with one common denominator, namely charcoal grilling. All the dishes served here have been grilled in some way, so that they have a distinctive barbecued flavour. However, although the chef’s Brazilian origins are obvious in many different ways, the ingredients are resolutely local, some even from the restaurant’s own farm. The friendly service makes guests feel completely at home, while the excellent wine selection is an added attraction – those produced on the estate itself are highly recommended.

Top-quality options such as lobster and caviar are prepared with precision and served with real skill – it comes as no surprise to learn that Philip previously worked with renowned chefs such as Joël Robuchon and Alain Passard. An excellent new address for the Venetian Lagoon!

This chef makes traditional Neapolitan pizzas, which are large in size and have a soft dough. The restaurant doesn’t take reservations – if it’s busy you just leave your name and wait to be called.

For this dish, he prepares dried Gragnono pasta in the same way as a risotto, using a broth made with one-third beef stock, one-third parmesan cheese and one-third onions. He then blends this with sour butter and Abruzzo saffron to create a dish that is truly delicious and seemingly simple, despite its complex preparation. The wine list continues to evolve, boasting some 600 labels and including a few rare regional wines.

Fish and seafood obviously take pride of place, although there’s also room on the menu for meat, inspired by the Marche’s traditional game dishes – the delicious skewered pigeon is cooked to perfection! The colourful dining experience here is enhanced by the owner’s warm welcome, with Mauro’s sister Catia and his son Filippo working alongside the chef.

426	La Tana Gourmet	via Kaberlaba 19	Asiago	36012	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Contemporary	Once a mountain refuge, the red house that overlooks this plateau is now home to one of the most interesting and avant-garde gourmet restaurants in Italy. Founder Alessandro Dal Degan, who offers a long surprise tasting menu (a culinary voyage, as he calls it), will take you on a journey through his beloved mountains, the Adriatic and beyond. Entrust yourself to his care in a spirit of curiosity and openness and prepare to explore new horizons. Dishes often include combinations that will sound unusual to you, but instead of picking these apart and thinking about the individual components, try to savour their complex, contrasting and yet harmonious flavours. As a result, this new and extraordinary experience will introduce you to some remarkable and occasionally unforgettable dishes. In addition to the musical backdrop (which provides the perfect soundtrack to the cuisine), special mention should be made of the wine pairings that come courtesy of business partner Enrico Maglio, who oversees the carefully researched and surprising wine list. The partnership with various local suppliers, which helps to showcase the region’s produce, is also highly commendable.

Although the restaurant offers an à la carte, our inspectors recommend the tasting menu with its fine balance of delicate flavours and original combinations that offer a hint of Eastern influence and pleasing contrasts in cooking methods and temperatures. The wine selection reflects the owner’s tastes: a slight emphasis on sparkling wines from the other side of the Alps, but also something for everyone.

Situated in the heart of the Sassi district, the restaurant enjoys the perfect location for a post-dinner stroll through one of Italy’s most charming historic centres, especially at night when the soft light gives the town a haunting appearance when viewed from the belvedere at Piazza Duomo.

Always true to themselves, without any need to look for sudden modern changes of direction, the simplicity of the cuisine, which matches the vintage style of the rooms, is their absolute direction, both in the pairings and in the ultra-classic cooking techniques; as long as the quality of the fish (mostly local) and the comforting quality of the end result remain unchanged, it will always be a pleasure to recommend this place above the fashions.

His focus is mainly on meat dishes, which are full of contrasting yet harmoniously balanced flavours (vegetable-meat, fatty-acidic, sweet-sour, soft-crunchy etc). Francesco’s brother Luca takes care of the wine and front of house with skill and dedication; the wine list is extensive and well structured, subdivided into two separate sections (Italy and the rest of the world). Bracali has established a partnership with the local diocese, including helping with the social integration of refugees and managing food waste. In the dining room, works of art are exhibited on a rotation basis and listed in a catalogue.

The successful partnership of father and son (Fabrizio and Andrea Girasoli) in the kitchen results in an extensive menu featuring meat and fish dishes alike. The culinary techniques in evidence are equally at ease in classic-style dishes (superb langoustine from the Tyrrhenian sea freshly cooked on a lava stone and served with a frothy cocktail sauce, vegetable flowers and fruit) and more creative fare (such as the cocoa cigar stuffed with foie gras, apple and hazelnut – a dish dedicated to Puccini). The restaurant is run in a way that manages to be friendly yet at the same time incredibly professional, while the front of house and service is expertly overseen by the chef’s wife Mariella.

Atman offers just one tasting menu which changes constantly in line with the seasons and market availability, in order to allow chef Marco Cahssai to express his imaginative talents to the full. Among the creations on the interesting new menu, don’t miss the spaghetti with five types of tomato, which demonstrates a play of techniques and is full of flavour – the dish is served cold in order to allow the aromatic seasoning to shine through. Also worth sampling is the glazed pigeon served with plums which emphasise its succulent texture. Make sure you ask for wine-pairing recommendations – the often intense contrasts of the dishes require careful attention to ensure the right balance.

823	Venissa	fondamenta Santa Caterina 3	Mazzorbo	30142	Italy	€€€€	Country cooking, Contemporary	Far away from the tourist hordes, Venissa is situated in a small walled vineyard dating back to the Middle Ages – complete with 14C belltower – on the small island of Mazzorbo, a magical setting which is perfect for a short stroll before settling down to eat. In addition to the Dorona di Venezia vineyard, the restaurant also has a kitchen garden which provides most of its vegetables, including unusual varieties such as “castraure”, a type of local artichoke. Once out of the garden, you come to a small wooden bridge which links Mazzorbo to neighbouring Burano, where you can complete your visit to the lagoon by exploring the lacemakers’ shops and admiring the colourful local houses. The main focus here, however, is the cuisine – and excellent cuisine it is too! Chefs Chiara Pavan and Francesco Brutto describe their dishes as “ambientale” (environmental) because of the close connection between the lagoon and the Upper Adriatic: the menu features plenty of fish and vegetables and almost no meat. Guests choose their number of courses and the dishes come as a surprise, accompanied by organic wine pairings. At the Osteria Contemporanea next door the dishes are simpler but still full of flavour.

846	Bistrot	viale Franceschi 14	Forte dei Marmi	55042	Italy	€€€€	Seafood, Italian Contemporary	Despite its name, this is in fact a gourmet restaurant and not a simple bistro. It is run by the Vaiani, a family of professional restaurateurs and hoteliers who have entrusted the kitchen here to talented chef Andrea Mattei. This partnership has strengthened the style of Bistrot, which is somewhere between traditional and modern in feel and where the quality of the ingredients has always been of utmost importance. The restaurant is particularly renowned for its excellent fish, most of which comes from the Tyrrhenian sea, while it also boasts two wood-fired ovens in which the chef bakes different, truly delicious breads and cooks some of his dishes. The wine selection is a further attraction – the beautiful wine cellar is home to just under 2 000 different labels, with the choice of champagnes and Burgundy wines meriting special mention.

The “malga” is also the symbol of what is now one of the best restaurants in the Fassa valley. All that remains of the “malga” today is its name and the panoramic location above the village and the valley, views of which can be enjoyed from the new veranda dining room decorated in minimalist Alpine style with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The contemporary, regionally inspired cuisine served here is of high quality, prepared by the skilful owner who is a naturally talented chef. There’s also a tasting menu, which combines Trentino influences with Mediterranean touches.

940	Felix Lo Basso home & restaurant	via Carlo Goldoni 36	Milan	20129	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary, Creative	Brilliant chef Felix Lo Basso’s menu is inspired by northern Europe: he offers one single menu that changes regularly depending on market availability and that requires all diners to book ahead and eat at the same time. Although the dishes are inventive and occasionally elaborate, the chef often creates unique reinterpretations of recipes and ingredients from his native Puglia, occasionally with an original Asian twist. Beyond the small rooms used for private dinners, the main dining room features an elegant counter along which guests can sit and watch the chefs at work, with Felice cooking and entertaining his diners with his full range of personal skills to put guests at ease. We’re going to keep the dessert a secret but will give you just one word as a clue – Nuvola (the Italian for cloud).

From this, he decided to branch out and open a pizzeria “four steps from the sea” (hence the name Quattro Passi), which over the years his son Antonio and now his grandson Fabrizio have transformed into a temple to Mediterranean cuisine. Flavours, strong technique and quality ingredients combine to create an exciting feast for the tastebuds which finishes with a selection of small chocolate eggs with unusual flavours such as roquefort, rocket, chilli pepper and lemon. A host of different influences (the sea, the Sannio region, France, Japan) and ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes, Amalfi lemons) come together in Fabrizio’s cuisine, resulting in dishes that are simple, delicious and full of flavour. It’s not an easy journey to Marina del Cantone, but once here you’ll be warmly welcomed by Raffaele and his team, after which you can sit back and enjoy a truly memorable dining experience.
