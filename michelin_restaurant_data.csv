The Ashbee Hotel,"Viale San Pancrazio n.46, Taormina, Italy",,,Italy,,Contemporary Classic & Lively,"Built steps away from the ruins of an ancient Greek amphitheater in Taormina, perched on a cliff overlooking the Ionian Sea, with a garden full of citrus trees, the Ashbee would almost be too insistently Sicilian, too steadfastly true to its type, if it weren’t for its English heritage. Instead it’s lent a charming dose of eccentricity by its history as the villa of a British colonel who retired here in the first decade of the 20th century. It’s an eccentricity that the hotel has preserved without being so slavish about it that you end up with a creaky bed or with a creepy aristocrat staring at you from behind a picture frame. Quite the opposite: the hotel feels meticulously updated, even new.Designed by and later named for Robert Charles Ashbee, an architect in the Arts and Crafts lineage of William Morris, the Ashbee’s twenty-four guest rooms are all unique, fitted out with a mix of contemporary and antique furniture to complement the art. Many of the suites include private terraces and windowed alcoves overlooking the long coastline and the gardens. Should Arts and Crafts bring to mind flowering vines and little birds, know that the Ashbee’s dominant color is a vibrant white made all the brighter by the wash of Mediterranean sun — white walls, white curtains, white trim, crisp white sheets — with the occasional well-placed splash of color in the form of a plush purple chair or a vase full of flowers.There’s much to tout about the Ashbee and its location, a short walk from the restaurants and boutiques of Taormina’s center and a boat-ride from the sea-glass beach on Isola Bella, but we’d be especially remiss if we didn’t mention the pool. Set beneath an expansive terrace with spectacular views of the coastline, circled by palm trees, the pool, with its turquoise water and its infinity-style edge, seems to bleed into the Ionian Sea and its Mediterranean surroundings in a way that should impress even those of us lucky enough to have grown bored of infinity pools. This is an old home in a well-established tourist destination, but happily, there’s plenty here that the colonel himself might have a hard time recognizing.Please note: The Ashbee Hotel is closed annually, February through the end of March.",,,,,built step away ruin ancient greek amphitheat taormina perch cliff overlook ionian sea garden full citru tree ashbe would almost insist sicilian steadfastli true type english heritag instead lent charm dose eccentr histori villa british colonel retir first decad 20th centuri eccentr hotel preserv without slavish end creaki bed creepi aristocrat stare behind pictur frame quit opposit hotel feel meticul updat even later name robert charl ashbe architect art craft lineag william morri ashbe twenti four guest room uniqu fit mix contemporari antiqu furnitur complement art mani suit includ privat terrac window alcov overlook long coastlin garden art craft bring mind flower vine littl bird know ashbe domin color vibrant white made brighter wash mediterranean sun white wall white curtain white trim crisp white sheet occasion well place splash color form plush purpl chair vase full much tout ashbe locat short walk restaur boutiqu taormina center boat ride sea glass beach isola bella especi remiss mention pool set beneath expans terrac spectacular view coastlin circl palm tree pool turquois water infin style edg seem bleed ionian sea mediterranean surround way impress even u lucki enough grown bore infin pool old home well establish tourist destin happili plenti colonel might hard time note ashbe hotel close annual februari end march,0.02914647063885358

Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria,"Piazza Tasso 34, Sorrento, Italy",,,Italy,,Traditional Elegance & Quiet,"The Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria benefits from a phenomenal location, right in the heart of Sorrento, high on a cliff overlooking the harbor and separated from the bustling Piazza Tasso by orange groves and acres of parkland. The hotel itself comprises three separate villas, all built between 1834 and 1880. This is a true Grand Hotel in the old style, its past guests including Wagner and Goethe, and the opera singer Enrico Caruso was a resident for a time in the twenties, his suite today remaining more or less as he left it. As if that weren't enough, it was once the home of Emperor Augustus himself.The hotel, long Sorrento's finest, has been restored recently, but not redesigned — rooms are still outfitted with period furniture, and ornate frescoes decorate the ceilings of some suites. The only modern intrusions are those most necessary for survival. Most rooms have balconies overlooking the gardens or the Bay of Naples.Restaurants include the traditional Vittoria dining room, all 19th-century elegance; the Orangerie for glamorous poolside plates and drinks; and the MICHELIN-Starred Terrazza Bosquet, which boasts stunning bay views and candlelit outdoor dinners accompanied by a small orchestra in the warm season. For starters, we suggest champagne and wisteria-gazing at the Pergola. Or immerse yourself in the serenity and Feng shui sensibilities at Boutique Spa La Serra, formerly a 19th-century greenhouse, steeped in the surrounding orchard's perfume and floods of natural sunlight.Fifty meters below the hotel is the seafront, and the hotel's private elevator transports guests down the cliffside, to the harbor. Here there are boats available for hire, for exploring the coastline, and hydrofoil services link Sorrento with Capri, Naples, and Ischia. From Naples to Pompeii and round to the Amalfi Coast, the entire region is beautifully scenic and rich with history (the hotel's gardens are now home to authentic Roman columns unearthed during construction) — and the Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria is an ideal home base from which to venture forth and explore.",,,,,grand hotel excelsior vittoria benefit phenomen locat right heart sorrento high cliff overlook harbor separ bustl piazza tasso orang grove acr parkland hotel compris three separ villa built 1834 true grand hotel old style past guest includ wagner goeth opera singer enrico caruso resid time twenti suit today remain less left enough home emperor augustu hotel long sorrento finest restor recent redesign room still outfit period furnitur ornat fresco decor ceil suit modern intrus necessari surviv room balconi overlook garden bay includ tradit vittoria dine room 19th centuri eleg orangeri glamor poolsid plate drink michelin star terrazza bosquet boast stun bay view candlelit outdoor dinner accompani small orchestra warm season starter suggest champagn wisteria gaze pergola immers seren feng shui sensibl boutiqu spa la serra formerli 19th centuri greenhous steep surround orchard perfum flood natur meter hotel seafront hotel privat elev transport guest cliffsid harbor boat avail hire explor coastlin hydrofoil servic link sorrento capri napl ischia napl pompeii round amalfi coast entir region beauti scenic rich histori hotel garden home authent roman column unearth construct grand hotel excelsior vittoria ideal home base ventur forth explor,0.03327125949243914

Capri Tiberio Palace,"Via Croce 11-15, Capri, Italy",,,Italy,,Contemporary Classic & Quiet,"Italy is strewn with jaw-dropping destinations — it’s hardly fair that the Amalfi Coast and the Gulf of Naples should find themselves joined by no less scenic a neighbor than Capri. It seems a bit greedy to be hoarding all that seaside majesty, which probably explains why the Roman Emperor Tiberius established his villa on the island. Today, of course, Capri caters to visitors with a slightly less reclusive bent. With its status as one of the world’s most beguiling hotspots firmly established, the island plays host to a number of remarkably low-key yet jazzy hotels, of which the Capri Tiberio Palace is a stunning example.Capri Tiberio Palace embodies the kind of effortless mod-Italian hospitality that takes its cues from the suave cool of sixties cinema. Aided by a palette of soft creams, the environment announces itself with the lightest of touches, like a pair of white linen pants. The 54 guestrooms don’t lay the décor on very thick — you’ll find an art object here, a black-and-white photo there — because the view does all the heavy lifting. The hotel is perched just high enough to provide a good look at the island’s greenery, dotted with villas cascading down to the sea.All this talk of the Palace’s gentle cool factor is not to say that it doesn’t positively swing — from the mojito bar on the roof deck to Terrazza Tiberio, the Mediterranean restaurant serving a range of kosher dishes made with local ingredients, there’s plenty of opportunity to do more than just kick back. Get your evening started with a sunset cocktail at the Cuban-inspired Jacky bar, then hit the town’s central piazzetta, which is only two minutes from the front door.Please note: Capri Tiberio Palace is open seasonally, April through October.",,,,,itali strewn jaw drop destin hardli fair amalfi coast gulf napl find join less scenic neighbor capri seem bit greedi hoard seasid majesti probabl explain roman emperor tiberiu establish villa island today cours capri cater visitor slightli less reclus bent statu one world beguil hotspot firmli establish island play host number remark low key yet jazzi hotel capri tiberio palac stun tiberio palac embodi kind effortless mod italian hospit take cue suav cool sixti cinema aid palett soft cream environ announc lightest touch like pair white linen pant 54 guestroom lay décor thick find art object black white photo view heavi lift hotel perch high enough provid good look island greeneri dot villa cascad talk palac gentl cool factor say posit swing mojito bar roof deck terrazza tiberio mediterranean restaur serv rang kosher dish made local ingredi plenti opportun kick back get even start sunset cocktail cuban inspir jacki bar hit town central piazzetta two minut front note capri tiberio palac open season april octob,0.0013852938403001113

Brunelleschi Hotel,"Piazza Santa Elisabetta, 3, Florence, Italy",3,,Italy,,Contemporary Classic & Lively,"There’s no question the Brunelleschi Hotel has a legitimate claim to the name. With its top-floor view taking in the entire panorama of Brunelleschi’s masterpiece, the Florence Cathedral, it’s more or less as close as you can get to the Duomo without taking religious orders. The location has always been a strength, and after a very thorough renovation, the Brunelleschi can finally boast of interiors that are worthy of the view.That’s “worthy of,” not equal to. The focus, even inside, is on the cathedral, and these subtly contemporary spaces, with their sparkling antique-style furnishings, do their best to frame the views, whether literal ones, through the windows, or virtual ones in the form of architectural photographs of the cathedral’s details.Key, perhaps, is the fact that it’s a hotel that would still function admirably in a less picturesque setting. The physical comforts are up to the current Italian luxury-boutique standards, complete with 42-inch televisions and plump platform beds.Downstairs there’s a private museum, which does its best to unite the building’s historical threads, from the Roman caldarium to the old church foundation to the Byzantine-era tower. And of course you’re surrounded by more history than you could reasonably be expected to absorb — not to mention more designer shopping than any one charge account could possibly handle. The restaurant, Santa Elisabetta, is certainly worth a visit; it’s been honored with not one but two MICHELIN Stars. And the same goes for the gym — it’s well-equipped, but you’d be better served walking Florence’s streets than racking up treadmill miles.",,,,,question brunelleschi hotel legitim claim name top floor view take entir panorama brunelleschi masterpiec florenc cathedr less close get duomo without take religi order locat alway strength thorough renov brunelleschi final boast interior worthi worthi equal focu even insid cathedr subtli contemporari space sparkl antiqu style furnish best frame view whether liter one window virtual one form architectur photograph cathedr perhap fact hotel would still function admir less picturesqu set physic comfort current italian luxuri boutiqu standard complet 42 inch televis plump platform privat museum best unit build histor thread roman caldarium old church foundat byzantin era tower cours surround histori could reason expect absorb mention design shop one charg account could possibl handl restaur santa elisabetta certainli worth visit honor one two michelin star go gym well equip better serv walk florenc street rack treadmil mile,0.0017295427757415731

Bellevue Hotel & Spa,"Rue Grand Paradis, 22, Cogne, Italy",22,,Italy,,Traditional Elegance & Secluded,"As Alpine resorts go, Cogne is low-key. Though close to the Swiss border and within easy reach of the Piedmont wine region, it’s tucked away in a quiet and relatively undeveloped corner of the Aosta Valley, on the edge of Italy’s oldest national park, the fittingly named Gran Paradiso. It’s not, in other words, the kind of place where new boutique hotels are opening every season. Bellevue Hotel & Spa, for instance, is a family-owned, and it’s been in business for almost a century — just after the park was founded, even before the concept of a modern ski resort existed around here.In 1926, the year after the hotel was built, Italy passed a law preventing further construction in the area. So the Bellevue stands virtually alone on the gloriously verdant meadows of Sant’Orso, at the foot of the mountains, facing spectacular views of the Gran Paradiso Glacier.The hotel’s old-fashioned grandeur, a quality that the family has perfected over four generations, has been continuously updated throughout the years. There are 36 guest rooms and suites, cozily outfitted with wooden and stone floors, antique furniture, grandfather clocks, and floral drapery framing windows that face snow-capped mountains. Many have four-poster beds and bathtubs, and some have private balconies. The Angel’s Nest suite, a new addition to the hotel, features wide picture windows overlooking a jaw-dropper of a landscape view. Three freestanding chalets, almost entirely lined in wood and warmed by fireplaces, have a more rustic feel.Guest rooms aside, the old-world charm of the Bellevue really shines through in its impressive variety of thoroughly civilized public spaces. In addition its restaurants, The Bellevue and Le Petit Bellevue, there’s a brasserie, a terrace open for lunch in favorable weather, and the Bar à Fromage, housed in a converted alpine dairy. In summer months, you could also hike to the alpine hut La Maison à l’Alpage, hosting open-air barbecues once a week.Regardless of the weather, there’s always a dip in one of two indoor pools, one reserved for adults only, or a spa treatment featuring local honey, milk, or wine and organic products by Profumo Santa Maria Novella, the classic perfume house in Florence.

Il Pellicano,"Località Sbarcatello, Porto Ercole, Italy",,,Italy,,Contemporary Classic & Secluded,"In a way, Il Pellicano's location is notable for its lack of competing attractions. Many of Italy’s most extraordinary hotels are set in places that are elbow-to-elbow with hotels, and just as packed with travelers. Not so here. This region of southern Tuscany, the Maremma, was undiscovered country for international travelers when Il Pellicano opened its doors in the Sixties. And even today, under the ownership of the same family’s next generation, Il Pellicano is a destination unto itself.It’s certainly got all the ingredients: a gorgeous (if rocky) coastline, a spectacular view of the Tyrrhenian Sea, and some of the finest weather in the Mediterranean. And the relative isolation of Il Pellicano is a large part of its charm — this place feels private in a way few hotels, even high-end ones, can match.None of which would matter if Il Pellicano itself weren’t a thoroughly impressive hotel in its own right. But it is. The guest rooms are classic in style and exceedingly well outfitted; the finest ones come with balconies or terraces that provide jaw-dropping sea views. Winding pathways negotiate terraced gardens all the way down to the private beach, though many guests prefer the swimming pool, with its own dramatic cliffside perch — and the finest views just might be those from the terrace of the hotel’s flagship Ristorante Il Pellicano.",,,,,way il pellicano locat notabl lack compet attract mani itali extraordinari hotel set place elbow elbow hotel pack travel region southern tuscani maremma undiscov countri intern travel il pellicano open door sixti even today ownership famili next gener il pellicano destin unto certainli got ingredi gorgeou rocki coastlin spectacular view tyrrhenian sea finest weather mediterranean rel isol il pellicano larg part charm place feel privat way hotel even high end one would matter il pellicano thoroughli impress hotel right guest room classic style exceedingli well outfit finest one come balconi terrac provid jaw drop sea view wind pathway negoti terrac garden way privat beach though mani guest prefer swim pool dramat cliffsid perch finest view might terrac hotel flagship ristorant il pellicano,0.018047268630370143

It’s not so much a beach hotel as a riviera hotel, more butler-served day-bed cabanas than flip-flops and sandy toes. It’s also a very pleasant reminder that all those sea breezes wafting toward the vineyards and villas to the east had to come from somewhere, and that somewhere turns out to be a stunning rocky coast with a scene all its own — stylish seaside restaurants and late-night dance parties sharing the land’s end with laid-back beach strollers and Florentines escaping from the city.But back to the hotel. Its twenty-eight rooms check all the right boxes for modern luxury; they’re sunny and spacious with parquet floors and oversized windows, fitted with designer Italian furniture and glass-walled bathrooms (with privacy curtains), wired with Bose sound systems, soundproofed against your neighbors’ Bose sound systems, hung with enormous LCD TVs, lit to your mood in high-tech fashion, and instead of tired mini-fridges there are in-room wine fridges that are stocked with a well curated bottle selection.Despite the hotel’s size, the rooms are really only the beginning. At the spa, you can experience all the greatest hits of international steaming, cooling and cleaning in a single “wellbeing circuit,” consisting of a Finnish sauna, cold lavender mist shower, Turkish hamam, Russian banya, “cold mint storm,” “ice cascade,” and finally a well-earned rest in the tea room. If that sounds a bit intense, there are a couple of gorgeous pools as well, one indoor and one outdoor, not to mention the hotel’s full-service private beach club and, for a little more distance from your fellow guests, its own luxury yacht.The highlights, though, are the bars and restaurants, sprinkled about the beach and pools and terraces and even the roof. Some have sea views, others are set beneath the backdrop of the Apuan Alps (full of Cararra marble, for what that’s worth), and some have vantage points where you can admire both. In short, there’s mountains and greenery and sea-breezes galore, but it’s hardly back-to-basics.How to get there:Galileo Galilei Airport (Pisa) is 30 minutes away by car.

Art Hotel Villa Fiorella,"Via Vincenzo Maggio, 3, Massa Lubrense, Italy",3,,Italy,,Modern Design & Quiet,"Massa Lubrense is perhaps best known as a stop on the way to the Amalfi Coast, or a place to catch a boat across the Gulf of Naples to the island of Capri. But it’s a worthy destination in its own right. It’s here, according to Greek legend, that sirens first lured sailors to crash into the rocky shore. Looking down at the coastline from Art Hotel Villa Fiorella, a quiet boutique hotel set in an olive grove high over the water, it’s easy to believe in the myth.The settlement is old as the hills, but the hotel isn’t. The villa is actually a relatively new construction, and after extensive restorations in 2016, it feels thoroughly modern. Inside, Villa Fiorella Art Hotel is all pale wood, pristine white, and wide picture windows framing the sea and sky. The views are the thing here, whether you’re savoring the landscape from the vantage point of your bed or the infinity pool or one of the hotel’s sunny terraces. So it makes sense that the decor is minimalist. There’s hardly any color at all, nothing to distract you from the spectacular vista below — save for a bold nautical stripe here, a single long-stemmed rose in a ceramic vase over there, a small drawing or painting by an Italian artist on the wall. (This is an art hotel, after all, but most of the collection is on display in Villa Fiorella’s sculpture garden.)All but the most standard rooms face the water. But even the standard rooms come with balconies and beautifully tiled bathrooms. Junior suites have free-standing soaking tubs, dramatically positioned between the bed and windows; duplex suites have two levels connected by an open staircase.The white and blue theme continues in the hotel’s glass-encased Terrazza Fiorella restaurant, where a fresh seafood tasting menu and a range of gourmet takes on regional dishes are served in front of a glorious backdrop. That’s Capri off in the distance, you’ll notice while sipping a spritz at Sky Bar. But the Blue Grotto can wait. Once you’ve arrived at Villa Fiorella, you’ll notice you’re not in a hurry to move onto the next place.Please note: Art Hotel Villa Fiorella is a seasonal hotel open April thru October annually.",,,,,massa lubrens perhap best known stop way amalfi coast place catch boat across gulf napl island capri worthi destin right accord greek legend siren first lure sailor crash rocki shore look coastlin art hotel villa fiorella quiet boutiqu hotel set oliv grove high water easi believ settlement old hill hotel villa actual rel new construct extens restor 2016 feel thoroughli modern insid villa fiorella art hotel pale wood pristin white wide pictur window frame sea sky view thing whether savor landscap vantag point bed infin pool one hotel sunni terrac make sens decor minimalist hardli color noth distract spectacular vista save bold nautic stripe singl long stem rose ceram vase small draw paint italian artist wall art hotel collect display villa fiorella sculptur garden standard room face water even standard room come balconi beauti tile bathroom junior suit free stand soak tub dramat posit bed window duplex suit two level connect open white blue theme continu hotel glass encas terrazza fiorella restaur fresh seafood tast menu rang gourmet take region dish serv front gloriou backdrop capri distanc notic sip spritz sky bar blue grotto wait arriv villa fiorella notic hurri move onto next note art hotel villa fiorella season hotel open april thru octob annual,0.016093607534643433

Country House Villadorata,"Contrada Portelle sn, Noto, Italy",,,Italy,,Contemporary Classic & Quiet,"Whether in the English countryside or in upstate New York or in Argentina, the term “country house” carries a certain set of expectations. And Country House Villadorata, an eight-room estate set among the vineyards and olive groves of southeastern Sicily, meets all of them. It’s a restful retreat with a long history — housed in the buildings of an old winery, it’s elegant and spacious, with splendid views and gracious service. But there’s a twist here. The curving swimming pool looks like it was lifted out of a hip seaside resort in Brazil; the clean architectural lines, sculptural furniture, and open, uncluttered spaces all have a distinctly urban feel.Not quite what you’d expect at a traditional country house, and that’s a good thing. Guest rooms are large and silent, with wood-beamed ceilings, stone floors, and minimalist decor, save for a few quirky details — a modern lime-green armchair here, old-fashioned painted tiles in the bathroom. All have French doors opening onto private balconies or patios where you can savor the views from a butterfly chair. All those grapes and olives: it’s enough to make you want to head to the poolside for a snack and a glass of something refreshing. If you’re staying in the superior suite, you won’t even have to go that far. It comes with its own stone swimming pool, not to mention views of the ocean.A leisurely Sicilian-style breakfast is served on the hotel’s patio. You could linger around the hotel and its peaceful surroundings all day, or hit the country roads in your rental car. Country House Villadorata is located just outside Noto, a Baroque city named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is the almost the very tip of the island, so in addition to gorgeous old churches and beautifully ripe lemons practically falling off the citrus trees, you’ll find idyllic beaches.

"Hotel Cipriani, A Belmond Hotel, Venice","Giudecca 10, Venice, Italy",,,Italy,,Traditional Elegance & Secluded,"Venice’s most famous hotel is neither a landmark palace, nor several hundred years old, and it stands not in the city proper, but across the lagoon on Giudecca Island. Nonetheless, the Hotel Cipriani is as synonymous with Venice as the Piazza San Marco. We suppose it has to do with the founder Giuseppe Cipriani, whose 1931 Harry’s Bar sated Hemingway’s legendary thirst, as well the only slightly less legendary thirsts of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Noël Coward and Gertrude Stein.The Palazzo Vendramin, formerly a 15th-century aristocratic residence, now forms a part of the Hotel Cipriani, and consists of sixteen rooms and suites with private butler service, and of course the incredible views of St. Mark’s Square from over the lagoon. However, other than the addition of the Palazzo, not much has changed since the Cipriani opened in 1958. The breakfast is unique and quite possibly the most romantic in the world — white mozzarella, blood orange juice, and golden espresso. And the service is to die for, especially the private butlers that come with a booking in the Palazzo rooms. There are thoughtful touches like the private motor launch that doesn’t stop running until the last guest has checked in for the night. There’s the slim, stylish clientele, decked out in sunglasses and Fendi baguettes. And now there’s a pool — oddly, the only one in the city, and the saltwater is heated for swimmers in spring and fall. (On balmy days, the thing to do is to have lunch at the poolside.)The rooms are perhaps the most old-fashioned thing about the Cipriani, with their pale Venetian color scheme, smallish bathrooms, and slightly antique appearance, but it’s all part of the old-world charm. The Cipriani is about atmosphere, not amenities. And besides, the décor has the advantage of not distracting you from the view, which may be the best thing about this hotel. For while others gaze out towards the lagoon and the islands, the Cipriani alone — from its perch on the Giudecca Island — looks onto Venice.

Some rooms are much more modern than others, but nowhere are they either needlessly avant-garde nor too terribly old-fashioned.If it’s primarily oriented towards the business traveler, that’s more a function of its city-center location — there’s plenty to recommend it to the leisure guest as well, not least the Eden Theatre, the in-house performance venue.

Rounded edges in a palette of fresh-from-the-factory white and gleaming chrome abound.

All of the rooms include LCD TVs that serve as PCs and entertainment systems, many of them mounted in places you might not expect — in a mirror, in the bathroom, or in the case of the Life suites, fixed to the ceiling above the bed. Then there are the screensaver-worthy views of the Adriatic through large picture windows, often set behind remote-operated curtains that lend additional drama to a gaze out the window. Opt for the “Lover’s” version of the Dolce Vista suite and you can enjoy views of a different sort; the room comes with a cocoon-like Corian bathtub in the center of the room.The entire sixth floor of the building is occupied by a spa wrapped in curved windows with yet more sea views.

Its 128 rooms and suites, however, have been subtly updated, thanks to a thorough restoration at the turn of the new century. Still intact are the original ornate tile floors, and now the timeless style is backed up with contemporary comforts and electronics.Among its original guests were the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and today’s Regina Isabella plays host to their modern counterparts.

Villa Cordevigo,"Loc. Cordevigo, Verona, Italy",,,Italy,,Traditional Elegance & Quiet,"Half an hour’s drive up the road from Verona is Villa Cordevigo, a classic Venetian country estate in the hills above Lake Garda. Right from the entrance it’s clear what you’re in for. After driving through the countryside, you make your way toward the villa by way of a long gravel road lined with ancient cypress trees, until the trees part to reveal the traditional stucco facade of the 18th-century building. In short, it’s that combination of pastoral tranquility and old-world sophistication that Italy does so well — and all the better that it’s on a vineyard estate in the Veneto, where the crowds are a bit thinner than in some of Italy’s other idyllic corners.Though the hotel has recently been refurbished, the lost-in-time effect is never spoiled. Guest rooms are fitted with the usual conveniences, including sharp screens, AC and a wi-fi signal, but you’ll much sooner notice the period furnishings, exposed wood-beam ceilings and heavy, flowing drapes over the windows. That is, the level of comfort is contemporary, right down to the fine bathrobes and Bulgari toiletries, but the visual style is traditional — and perfectly in keeping with the setting.Beyond the guest rooms, there’s quite a lot to explore. The well-kept Italianate gardens are a good place to start, and just beyond are two hundred and fifty private acres of vineyards and parkland, with quiet paths for hiking and biking. (For leisurely rides, the hotel has old-fashioned cruiser bikes complete with well-worn Brooks saddles.) And out past the property is some awfully inviting countryside, full of vineyards and castles and ancient Romanesque churches, to say nothing of the natural beauty of Lake Garda itself.Where things do get a bit more contemporary is at the villa’s restaurant. The cuisine walks that line of being rooted in tradition without quite seeming old-fashioned, while the room itself is immaculately white, if still recognizably part of an 18th-century villa. Throw in a quiet, relaxing spa and a sunny little pool ringed with loungers and parasols, and it’s the whole Venetian villa-hotel package.",,,,,half hour drive road verona villa cordevigo classic venetian countri estat hill lake garda right entranc clear drive countrysid make way toward villa way long gravel road line ancient cypress tree tree part reveal tradit stucco facad 18th centuri build short combin pastor tranquil old world sophist itali well better vineyard estat veneto crowd bit thinner itali idyl hotel recent refurbish lost time effect never spoil guest room fit usual conveni includ sharp screen ac wi fi signal much sooner notic period furnish expos wood beam ceil heavi flow drape window level comfort contemporari right fine bathrob bulgari toiletri visual style tradit perfectli keep guest room quit lot explor well kept italian garden good place start beyond two hundr fifti privat acr vineyard parkland quiet path hike bike leisur ride hotel old fashion cruiser bike complet well worn brook saddl past properti aw invit countrysid full vineyard castl ancient romanesqu church say noth natur beauti lake garda thing get bit contemporari villa restaur cuisin walk line root tradit without quit seem old fashion room immacul white still recogniz part 18th centuri villa throw quiet relax spa sunni littl pool ring lounger parasol whole venetian villa hotel packag,0.018525835854699652

Hotel Punta Tragara,"Via Tragara 57, Capri, Italy",,,Italy,,Contemporary Classic & Quiet,"It’s humbling, if you’re from somewhere other than Italy, to think about how naturally blessed the peninsula and its islands have been. And they haven’t exactly let all that natural beauty go to waste either. Seemingly everywhere you look is another hidden gem, another one-of-a-kind hotel. Take, for example, the Hotel Punta Tragara, on the island of Capri.Here, on the edge of the town of Capri, barely fifteen minutes’ walk from the city center, is a villa clinging to the side of the cliff, a villa which just happens to have been subject to some design work by a man named Le Corbusier. The forty-four rooms are decorated in a classic twentieth-century style, to match the building’s early modernism — bright colors play off monochrome backgrounds, and the Mediterranean sun seeps into every corner.Part historical treasure, part blindingly gorgeous villa, the Hotel Punta Tragara is remarkably low-key. Guests admire the view from their balconies or from alongside either of two heated pools, and partake of massages and beauty treatments in advance of dinner by candlelight at Monzu restaurant. It’s a genuinely laid-back and friendly place, which is surprising as there’s plenty it could be pompous about.Please note: Punta Tragara is open seasonally, from April through October. A three-night minimum is required during the high season.How to Get There:The island of Capri is approximately 40 minutes by hydrofoil from Naples Harbor. Hotel Punta Tragara is located on a pedestrian only road.  Luggage service to the hotel can be arranged at 10 euros per bag. From the main port of Marina Grande guests should take the funicular to Capri town and walk to the hotel from there (approximately 15 minutes).",,,,,humbl somewher itali think natur bless peninsula island exactli let natur beauti go wast either seemingli everywher look anoth hidden gem anoth one kind hotel take exampl hotel punta tragara island edg town capri bare fifteen minut walk citi center villa cling side cliff villa happen subject design work man name le corbusi forti four room decor classic twentieth centuri style match build earli modern bright color play monochrom background mediterranean sun seep everi histor treasur part blindingli gorgeou villa hotel punta tragara remark low key guest admir view balconi alongsid either two heat pool partak massag beauti treatment advanc dinner candlelight monzu restaur genuin laid back friendli place surpris plenti could pompou note punta tragara open season april octob three night minimum requir high get island capri approxim 40 minut hydrofoil napl harbor hotel punta tragara locat pedestrian road luggag servic hotel arrang 10 euro per bag main port marina grand guest take funicular capri town walk hotel approxim 15 minut,0.0014180121221317702

Mandarin Oriental Milan,"Via Andegari, 9, Milan, Italy",9,,Italy,,Modern Design & Lively,"Milan is hardly uncharted territory for luxury brands. The world’s high-end hoteliers, in particular, are at the top of their game here, going out of their way to adapt their five-star offerings to the particular style and character of the city — to its 18th-century architecture as well as its status as a capital of contemporary design. Add Mandarin Oriental to this rarefied list. Spanning four classic buildings around the corner from La Scala, the Mandarin Oriental Milan went straight to the source: architect and designer Antonio Citterio, the man who’s responsible for far more than his fair share of Italy’s contemporary luxury interiors.It’s hard to overstate just how excellent a location this is, equally close to the Duomo cathedral and to the shopping mecca that is the Golden Quadrangle. That sort of thing comes at a price, but you can trust Mandarin Oriental to ensure that you get what you pay for. The rooms are spacious and lavish, showcasing a level of attention to detail that fits right in to Northern Italy’s reverence for craftsmanship. And the suites very quickly ascend to extreme heights of luxury, with bathrooms that rival some hotel spas, and optional terraces that offer a rare perspective on a city that’s not known for open skies.There’s a proper spa, of course, so you don’tactuallyhave to make do with your massive bath. There’s plentiful meeting and events space, which is actually useful, as chances are the M.O. is substantially more impressive than whatever corporate headquarters you’re here to visit. And the starred restaurant, Seta, looks beyond the Lombard classics, incorporating influences from southern Italy, from France, and (fittingly) from all across the Pacific.

Grand Hotel Principe di Piemonte,"Piazza Giacomo Puccini, 1, Viareggio, Italy",1,,Italy,,Traditional Elegance & Lively,"Apparently the prince prefers the coast. Though the hotel is called the Grand Hotel Principe di Piemonte, it stands on the central promenade in the picturesque town of Viareggio, on the coast of northern Tuscany. One glance at the building and you know what the place is about, its ornate 1920s façade rising in all its splendor above Viareggio’s long sandy beach and the Tyrrhenian Sea just beyond. In short, it’s a classic European resort-hotel in a classic European resort-town.What really sets one room apart from another is the quality of the views, with the best ones featuring balconies that overlook the sea.

Villa Neri Resort & Spa,"Contrada Arrigo, Linguaglossa, Italy",,,Italy,,Modern Design & Quiet,"If you think of volcanoes in Italy, Mount Vesuvius — Pompeii, and all that — probably springs to mind first. But Mount Etna, on Sicily’s eastern coast, is more than twice its size. Which is part of the reason why so many hotels in the region try to outdo each other, advertising the best views of the towering landmark, an active volcano that was named an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013. Villa Neri Resort & Spa is one of the privileged few that’s situated right on the slopes of Etna.It’s a resort, but with just 24 rooms, a rather intimate one. Villa Neri is more like, well, a villa — albeit a modern one — with spacious, well-appointed guest rooms, a thoroughly civilized dining room, well-tended gardens and quiet courtyards. But the aesthetic is surprisingly minimalist for the Sicilian countryside. Instead of romantic archways and antiques, the lobby has sleek ivory tile, coffered ceilings, and black modular furniture. Upstairs, some guest rooms are similarly modern, with floating beds, Arco lamps, and an sophisticated charcoal and white furnishings, while others feature statement pieces like hand-painted sinks and tiles. All feature marble bathrooms and a private balcony or patio, plus an LED TV and complimentary wi-fi.There’s a spa, Turkish bath, and lovely swimming pool — of course, the chaise lounges arranged around it are black. Not that Villa Neri is lacking for traditional charm. At an al fresco table at the hotel’s restaurant, Le Dodici Fontane, you can sit at a table covered in white linen and drink wine while enjoying the view of the surrounding vineyards, and, yes, the volcano.  Villa Neri might be a modern sort of getaway, but you’re still in the country, and Sicilians are rightfully famous for hospitality. Indeed, even though Taormina and its beaches are a short drive away from the hotel, Villa Neri provides guests access to a private stretch of coastline outfitted with umbrellas and chairs.How to get there: Villa Neri Resort & Spa is approximately 60 km by car from Catania Fontanarossa Airport via A18/E45 and SS120.",,,,,think volcano itali mount vesuviu pompeii probabl spring mind first mount etna sicili eastern coast twice size part reason mani hotel region tri outdo advertis best view tower landmark activ volcano name unesco world heritag site villa neri resort spa one privileg situat right slope resort 24 room rather intim one villa neri like well villa albeit modern one spaciou well appoint guest room thoroughli civil dine room well tend garden quiet courtyard aesthet surprisingli minimalist sicilian countrysid instead romant archway antiqu lobbi sleek ivori tile coffer ceil black modular furnitur upstair guest room similarli modern float bed arco lamp sophist charcoal white furnish other featur statement piec like hand paint sink tile featur marbl bathroom privat balconi patio plu led tv complimentari wi spa turkish bath love swim pool cours chais loung arrang around black villa neri lack tradit charm al fresco tabl hotel restaur le dodici fontan sit tabl cover white linen drink wine enjoy view surround vineyard ye volcano villa neri might modern sort getaway still countri sicilian right famou hospit inde even though taormina beach short drive away hotel villa neri provid guest access privat stretch coastlin outfit umbrella get villa neri resort spa approxim 60 km car catania fontanarossa airport via ss120,0.015855460864760907

La Posta Vecchia,"Palo Laziale, Ladispoli, Ladispoli, Italy",Ladispoli,,Italy,,Traditional Elegance & Quiet,"La Posta Vecchia, “the old post house,” is as understated a name as one can imagine for such a grand seaside palace. Once a carriage house for mail stages traveling up the coast north of Rome, it was bought and restored by the American industrialist J. Paul Getty, packed with antiquities and artworks as well as all the modern conveniences an eccentric billionaire could desire.Though only a hotel since after Getty’s death, it’s essentially as he left it, with few of the trappings of the modern hotel business and all the authenticity one would expect of a collection curated by the Getty Museum. The charm is not in ostentatious service, or state-of-the-art facilities, but in the elegance of the estate, whose rooms and suites are furnished with 17th-century antiques and look out over the Mediterranean Sea or the estate’s parks, full of artifacts of the Roman Empire.Unlike many a luxury hotel, La Posta Vecchia retains a certain aristocratic understatement, despite the sheer volume of priceless artworks and antiquities. Never do the interiors cross the line into nouveau riche excess, nor into prefab palace parody; this is the real thing, with no use for posturing. In the rooms you’ll feel like the house guests of modern aristocracy, and in the suites you may feel a bit like Getty himself, though given his notoriously tight wallet he’d probably have insisted on fetching his own room service.Facilities are minimal compared to most modern five-stars, with their spa treatments and driving ranges; here you’ll find a fine enough indoor pool, a handsome meeting room and little else, although the hotel's restaurant, the Cesar, recently obtained a Michelin star. Then again you’re here to spend the night in the splendor of a picture-book mansion, not a luxury theme park. Rome is just 40 minutes away, an easy enough jaunt in the hotel’s car, and if you can’t find something to entertain you there, then we will keep our peace for ever!How to get there: La Posta Vecchia is a 25-minute drive from Rome-Fiumicino Airport and a 30-minute drive from the port of Civitavecchia.",,,,,la posta vecchia old post hous underst name one imagin grand seasid palac carriag hous mail stage travel coast north rome bought restor american industrialist paul getti pack antiqu artwork well modern conveni eccentr billionair could hotel sinc getti death essenti left trap modern hotel busi authent one would expect collect curat getti museum charm ostentati servic state art facil eleg estat whose room suit furnish 17th centuri antiqu look mediterranean sea estat park full artifact roman mani luxuri hotel la posta vecchia retain certain aristocrat understat despit sheer volum priceless artwork antiqu never interior cross line nouveau rich excess prefab palac parodi real thing use postur room feel like hous guest modern aristocraci suit may feel bit like getti though given notori tight wallet probabl insist fetch room minim compar modern five star spa treatment drive rang find fine enough indoor pool handsom meet room littl els although hotel restaur cesar recent obtain michelin star spend night splendor pictur book mansion luxuri theme park rome 40 minut away easi enough jaunt hotel car find someth entertain keep peac ever get la posta vecchia 25 minut drive rome fiumicino airport 30 minut drive port civitavecchia,0.0012492364458705806

Rosewood Castiglion Del Bosco,"Località Castiglion del Bosco, Montalcino, Italy",,,Italy,,Contemporary Classic & Quiet,"This place is a big deal. There aren’t a lot of rooms, but in every other way it’s a big deal none the less. Basically, the intimate hotel portion of Rosewood Castiglion del Bosco is just the tip of the bucolic iceberg — in total, more than 5,000 acres of intact, 900-year-old agricultural estate property provide a spectacular backdrop. Wine is actively produced here and much of the property is comprised of preserved lands for grape growing or forests. The rest has been sensitively formed into a community of sandstone villas, with the original estate buildings at its heart. The idea is for guests to immerse themselves in the landscape, functions and pace of Tuscany, wander the massive property as if it’s the year 1552 and the estate belongs only to them. But in terms of Tuscan hotel luxury, it's also very much in the here and now, with two restaurants — one of them MICHELIN-Starred — as well as an organic kitchen garden, a cooking school, a fine spa and plentiful sport and fitness facilities.The suites are large, ranging from 580 to nearly 2,000 square feet. However, many feature giant terraces that are sometimes larger than the suite itself, stretching the experience luxuriously into the rolling landscape. The décor is traditional with the rustic, Tuscan color palette one expects, un-fussy wooden or wrought iron furnishings, and thick draperies to blow in the breeze. But to reiterate, as intoxicatingly comfortable as the suites may be, the experience is the estate in its ancient totality, to breathe and live slowly in the countryside that makes Tuscany Tuscany.And should the 5,000 acres of Tuscan countryside within the bounds of the estate prove insufficient, the villages and vineyards of the Val d’Orcia lie just beyond, while Siena is less than an hour’s drive away. There are a range of excursions to choose from, though there’s no need to stress over which one to do; any choice you make will be a good one.How to get there:Rosewood Castiglion del Bosco is about an hour and a half from Florence, 2 hours from Pisa and 2.5 hours from Rome. The estate also has an on-site helipad.

Biohotel Hermitage,"Via Castelletto Inferiore 69, Madonna di Campiglio, Italy",,,Italy,,Contemporary Classic & Quiet,"Like many of the most charming places to stay in Italy — former convents, recycled tobacco factories, restored winery buildings — the Biohotel Hermitage didn’t start out as a hotel. It was a farmhouse owned by a local family, later converted into a B&B, and then, in 1999, to a boutique-style property that’s considered the first eco-friendly hotel in the region. The region in question: the valleys of Trentino, the yang to the yin of the magnificent Dolomites mountain range in Italy’s northernmost region. It’s a place you come to ski, followed by après-ski, followed by a massage in the spa, followed by dinner with a view of the mountains, followed by cuddling next to the fireplace in your suite. Word to the wise: Biohotel Hermitage expects you to come with a loved one, of the romantic versus familial variety.And understandably so: this is a peaceful getaway that’s designed for canoodling. Dwarfed by the soaring landscape, it’s grand but cozy — and located outside the town of Madonna di Campiglio, it’s removed from those pesky ski-season crowds. Guest rooms are large and quiet, with heated floors, dark wood furnishings and crisp white sheets, spacious bathrooms with fixtures made of red Verona marble, and private balconies looking out over the mountains. Mini Suites and Junior Suites have more of a chic cabin feel, with high wood-beamed ceilings, multiple bathrooms, and separate sleeping or relaxing areas, ideal if you’re traveling with children.But you came to ski, right? Luckily, instructors at the Italian Ski Academy are available directly through the hotel, a free shuttle service runs to the slopes all day, and if you didn’t bring your own, you can rent gear through the shop run by the Maffei family, original owners of the farmhouse that became the Biohotel Hermitage. Afterward, choose a bottle of wine from the amply stocked stone cellar, or go for a dip in the pool — from the vantage point of the water, there are panoramic views of the mountains. Go for dinner at the one-MICHELIN-Star Stube Hermitage, or head to the Hermitage Spa for a couple’s massage.  A couple’s massage that can, of course, also take place in front of the fireplace back in your suite. You know what they say, or what they should say, if they don’t already say it: Northern Italy is for lovers.Please note: Biohotel Hermitage requires a minimum stay of two to seven nights, depending on the season.",,,,,like mani charm place stay itali former convent recycl tobacco factori restor wineri build biohotel hermitag start hotel farmhous own local famili later convert b b 1999 boutiqu style properti consid first eco friendli hotel region region question valley trentino yang yin magnific dolomit mountain rang itali northernmost region place come ski follow aprè ski follow massag spa follow dinner view mountain follow cuddl next fireplac suit word wise biohotel hermitag expect come love one romant versu famili understand peac getaway design canoodl dwarf soar landscap grand cozi locat outsid town madonna di campiglio remov peski ski season crowd guest room larg quiet heat floor dark wood furnish crisp white sheet spaciou bathroom fixtur made red verona marbl privat balconi look mountain mini suit junior suit chic cabin feel high wood beam ceil multipl bathroom separ sleep relax area ideal travel came ski right luckili instructor italian ski academi avail directli hotel free shuttl servic run slope day bring rent gear shop run maffei famili origin owner farmhous becam biohotel hermitag afterward choos bottl wine ampli stock stone cellar go dip pool vantag point water panoram view mountain go dinner one michelin star stube hermitag head hermitag spa coupl massag coupl massag cours also take place front fireplac back suit know say say alreadi say northern itali note biohotel hermitag requir minimum stay two seven night depend season,0.0

Floors and staircases are of marble, and contemporary artworks line the walls of the public spaces, with abundant sofas and chairs positioned for quiet contemplation. The pool area is a luxurious idyll, made a touch more dramatic by the astonishing view—whether from poolside, or from the underwater picture window, guests are treated to a panorama that takes in the hillsides and villages of the coastline and the deep blue sea beyond.The Rosselini restaurant, naturally, takes advantage of the view as well, seating guests out on the terrace to dine against the jaw-dropping scenery. And the views from the guest rooms are almost enough to overshadow the sheer luxury of the accommodations, where guests choose daily from a menu of Frette linens and bathe in Bulgari amenities, surrounded by hand-made tile and antique furnishings.
