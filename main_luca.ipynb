    "For this homework, no dataset has been provided. Instead, you have to build your own. Your search engine will run on text documents. So, here we detail the procedure to follow for the data collection. We strongly suggest you work on different modules when implementing the required functions. For example, you may have a crawler.py module, a parser.py module, and a engine.py module: this is a good practice that improves readability in reporting and efficiency in deploying the code. Be careful; you are likely dealing with exceptions and other possible issues!\n",

Your task is to collect the URL associated with each restaurant in this list. The output of this step should be a .txt file where each line contains a single restaurant’s URL. By the end, you should have approximately 2,000 restaurants on your list. The number changes daily, so some groups might have different number of restaurants."
